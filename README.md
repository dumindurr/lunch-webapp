# lunch-webapp
Manages lunch with people bringing and not bringing it at office

## But why?
Well, this solves a very personal (or whatever word that you use for a requirement by a selected few) need for a system. We eat together at work,
so we need to make sure we have the enough number of lunch packets for lunch. Now we calculate manually. One person calls or walks over to 
everyone and asks, "you have lunch?" and does a small arithmatic to determine if we need packets from outsite

## But one person eats one packet! Why oh why?
Nope, we eat one packet at a time, all people at once. So number of required packets is way less than the number present. So we can
manage people not bringing lunch and still eat a decent meal. Yeah. Its cool for bachelors. 

## So what the heck are you doing with this repo?
I'm going to ping everyone at lunchtime and get that update for food and do that calculation for packets online and tell someone who is
supposed to go shopping. :D
